 GER_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Zerstörer 1934 class was the first class of German destroyers built since World War I. They were armed with five 5\" guns and eight torpedo tubes. 16 ships were built, out of which 12 were the improved Zerstörer 1934A subclass."
 GER_destroyer_3_desc:0 "Zerstörer 1936A, known to the allies as Narvik Class destroyers, was designed to carry the new 150mm (5.9\") guns. Designed with three single guns aft and a twin gun in the bow, they were originally fitted with a single gun in the bow. Four of the eight ships of the class were later refitted with the twin turrets. A second group of seven destroyers were built to a slightly modified design with twin guns in the bow."
 GER_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Emden was the first large warship built in Germany after World War I. She was laid down in 1921 and commissioned in 1925. The armament consisted of eight 150mm (5.9\") guns in single turrets."
 GER_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Admiral Hipper Class heavy cruisers were the first heavy cruisers of the Kriegsmarine. Officially displacing 10,000 tons, in reality they displaced over 16000 tons. They were armed with eight 8\" guns in four twin turrets, with a secondary battery of twelve 105mm guns."
 GER_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "In 1939, the Kriegsmarine decided to replace three of the planned P-class cruisers with battlecruisers. This resulted in the O-class battlecruisers, armed with six 38cm (15\") guns in three twin turrets. The ships were designed with a displacement of 35,400 tons and a top speed of 35 knots. Construction orders were given for the three ships of the class, but none were started."
 GER_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Scharnhorst-class battleships were the first modern battleships to be built for the Kriegsmarine. They were built as a response to the French Dunkerque-class battlecruisers, themselves a response to the German Deutschland-class Panzerschiffe (Pocket Battleships). The Scharnhorst class is armed with nine 283mm (11\") guns in three triple turrets. Plans were made to up gun them with twin 380mm (15\") guns, but with the outbreak of the war, this never happened."
 GER_battleship_3_desc:0 "The two-ship Bismarck-class battleships were the largest warships built for the Kriegsmarine. The ships were designed in response to the new French battleships under construction, with a similar armament of eight 38cm (15\") guns as the Richelieu Class, with four twin turrets as opposed to the two quad turrets of the Richelieus. Bismarck is famous for the sinking of the British battlecruiser HMS Hood in the Battle of the Denmark Strait, but was subsequently hunted down and sunk before reaching port."
 GER_battleship_4_desc:0 "The German Plan Z envisioned a force of ten battleships in order to challenge the naval power of the United Kingdom. The H-class was a series of designs for the six battleships needed to meet the demands of the plan. Two ships of the H39 design were laid down at the outbreak of World War II, but construction was halted as the war begun. Neither of the ships were officially named, but Hindenburg was speculated as a possible name for the lead ship of the class. Had the ships been completed, they would have been augmented Bismarck Class ships, with a main battery of eight 40.6cm (16\") guns."
 GER_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The H44 Class was the last of the H-series of Battleship designs. With no limit on gun caliber or displacement, the H42 to H44 designs mounted increasingly heavier armament and armor protection, culminating in the 131,000 ton H44 design armed with eight 508mm (20\") guns."
 USA_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Balao Class was a continuation of the design rooted in the Tambor class. Improvements came in the form of hull reinforcement and upgrading the deck gun to a 5\"/24 caliber along with numerous subtle design improvements."
 USA_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Clemson Class destroyer continued with many design elements of its immediate predecessor, the Wickes Class. The Clemson had improved sea handling over the Wickes Class and was armed with 4\"/50 caliber main guns, a 3\"/23 caliber AA gun and 12 torpedo tubes. The class was aging and was nearly obsolete, but still comprised the bulk of the US Navy's Destroyer force."
 USA_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Fletcher Class represented a large step forward in terms of destroyer capability, thanks largely to its increase to 2500 tons. While keeping the 5\"/38 dual purpose guns and centerline torpedo arrangement, the class added an additional single turret and received significant increases in AA weaponry as well as improved range and larger displacement."
 USA_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Sumner Class continued on the Fletcher Class with displacement only marginally increased. The ship was able to take on more armament gaining dual 5\"/38 caliber guns and a much larger compliment of AA weaponry. The addition of a second rudder allowed for improve maneuvering during ASW operations."
 USA_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Omaha Class was initially designed to fill a key scouting role in the US Navy's WW1 fleet. A fast and capable class, the Omaha Class was armed with a formidable load out of 6\"/53 caliber guns in an 8x1 and 2x2 turret configuration and six torpedo launchers. The Omaha Class was aging but comprised of the bulk of the US Navy's Light Cruiser force."
 USA_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Brooklyn Class was designed with the Washington Naval Treaty in mind and so was restricted to 6\" guns. To maximize firepower, the Brooklyn's was armed with 15 of the new Mk16 6\" guns in triple turrets. The overall design was very balanced and was considered as the basis of all future cruiser designs for the US Navy."
 USA_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Cleveland Class was based on the Brooklyn Class, but without the Washington Naval Treaty restrictions. The Cleveland Class keeps the 15 6\" main gun arrangement, but increased its secondary 5\" armament greatly and added additional AA weaponry."
 USA_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Pensacola Class were designed under the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty, and sought to maximize firepower under the 8\" gun restriction. It was armed with a formidable armament of 10 x 8\"/55 guns. The hull armor was thin and the design was top heavy but capable. It formed the bulk of the US Navy's Heavy Cruiser force."
 USA_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Wichita Class ships improved armament over the Pensacola Class and its variants with a new turret design for its 8\"55 caliber guns and improved the fields of fire for its secondary armament of 5\"/38 guns. "
 USA_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Lexington Class was initially a reaction to Japan's Kongo class battlecruiser. Ordered by the Naval Act of 1916, the ships were intended to carry 16\" guns in dual turrets and be capable of 33 knots. After construction began, the US entered into the Washington Naval Treaty and the USS Lexington and USS Saratoga was converted to Carriers."
 USA_battleship_1_desc:0 "The New York Class battleships were the first US Battleships to be armed with the 14\"/45 caliber main guns. Numerous 5\"/51 guns provided secondary armament and over 10\" of armor."
 USA_battleship_2_desc:0 "The North Carolina Class was a challenging design and was the first battleship class built by the US Navy in 20 years. The US Navy required this class to meet the standards of Washington Naval Treaty, limited to 36,000 tons yet be armed with the 16\"/45 caliber guns and have improved armor while being capable of escorting the US Navy's fast aircraft carriers."
 USA_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Illinois Class continued with the design and role defined by the Iowa Class. It maintained speed and armament over armor. The Illinois Class increased the number of 16\"/50 caliber guns from 9 to 12 while it also improved boilers and machinery in order to provide more efficient high cruise speeds. Like the Montana Class, initial designs included four 4 6\" guns dual turrets, but this was reverted to the dual purpose 5\" twin turret emplacements to maximize AA capabilities."
 USA_carrier_3_desc:0 "With the lessons learned from the preceding Lexington, Ranger and Yorktown variant classes, the result was the Essex Class, a fast ship able to carry a large compliment of planes into battle. Damage control designs would also be carried over from the Yorktown class and a deck edge elevator was included to improve plane handling."
 USA_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "In 1920 the construction of the large South Dakota Class battleships fielding 12 x 16\"/50 guns started. The class would have ushered in a new era in heavy battleship design but was cancelled in 1922 to conform to the Washington Naval Treaty. With the Treaty no longer in effect and the threat of a secret Japanese battleship project we can modernize the design, increase displacement to over 55,000 tons and up gun the design with 18\"/50 caliber guns to create a new class of heavy battleship."
 USA_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Montana Class was bigger and more armored than the Illinois Class, sacrificing speed to accommodate the increase. Its main armament of 12 x 18\"/50 caliber guns and with our latest fire control system the Montana's firepower will be unmatched. Initial designs included 6\" guns, but this was changed to return to the dual purpose 5\" twin turret emplacements."
 SPA_submarine_2_desc:0 "The General Mola class was a class of four Italian Archimedes-class submarines commissioned in 1934 and transferred to the Nationalists in 1937. They were fairly large, displacing 880 tons, yet faster than most subs. They were armed with eight 533mm torpedo tubes and had a diving depth of 90m."
 SWE_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The two Öland-class destroyers represented a radical change from previous designs. They were launched and completed shortly after World War II. They were large, displacing 1,880 tons. They were armed with four 120mm/45 M44 guns in their main armament, and had a strong AA, torpedo, and ASW complement. They were slightly slower than earlier destroyers, but had a significantly improved range."
 TUR_submarine_4:0 "Sakayra Class"
 TUR_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Sakayra-class submarines were a series of U.S. Balao-class subs sold to Turkey after the war. They were very large submarines for their era, displacing over 1,520 tons. They had excellent range and speed, and were armed with ten 533mm torpedo tubes."
